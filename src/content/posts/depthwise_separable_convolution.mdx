Commonly used in networks as MobileNet and Xception, the depthwise separable convolutions consists of two steps: depthwise convolutions and 1×1 convolutions.

## Standard convolution

Before describing the depthwise separable convolution, it is worth revisiting the
typical convolution. For a concrete example,
let’s say an input layer of size 7×7×3 (height×width×channels),
and 128 filters of size 3×3×3, after applying one filter,
the output layer is of size 5×5×1 (only 1 channel), and grouped up with the 128 filters, 5×5×128.

```python
# Input volume with depth 3 and outputs 128 kernels
# Uses 3×3 convolutional kernel
conv_layer = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=128, kernel_size=3)
```

## Depthwise Separable Convolutions

Let’s see how we can achieve the <Underlined color="green">same transformation</Underlined>
as the standard convolution.

We **first** apply depthwise convolution to the input layer.
Instead of using a single filter of size 3×3×3, we will use 3 <Underlined>kernels separately</Underlined>.
Each filter has a size of 3×3×**1**, each kernel convolves with
1 channel of the input layer (<Underlined>1 channel only, not all channels</Underlined>!).
Each such convolution, in the example, will provide a map of size 5×5×1, and
**we will stack them** to create a 5×5×3 image. We shrunk the spatial dimension,
**but the depth is still the same as before**.

    width={800}
    height={300}

Then, it’s time for the **second** step, extend the depth by applying 1×1 convolutions,
as many as the depth we want to achieve, as for the example 128 filters.

    width={800}
    height={300}
    format="webp"
    className="w-full"
/>

With these steps, we also (as in the standard convolution) transform the input layer 7×7×3 into
the output layer 5×5×128 as for the standard convolution.
The overall process of the depthwise separable convolution would be:

```python
# Define depthwise separable convolutional layer
# Note how we use the groups parameter: At groups equals to in_channels,
# each input channel is convolved with its own set of filters
depthwise_conv_layer = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=3, kernel_size=3, groups=3)
pointwise_conv_layer = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=128, kernel_size=1)
```

The advantage of doing depthwise separable convolutions is the **efficiency**.
One needs much less operations for depthwise separable convolutions compared to standard convolutions.

Meanwhile for the standard convolutions we need to move 128 filters with
dimensionality 3×3×3 around the input 5×5 times, i.e., $128×3×3×3×5×5 =$ **86400 multiplications**,
the depthwise separable convolution uses 3 kernels 3×3×1 that moves 5×5 times, and
after that, 128 filters of dimensionality 1×1×3 that moves 5×5 times over the previous output,
i.e., $1×3×3×3×5×5 + 128×1×1×3×5×5 =$ **9600 multiplications**,
<Underlined color="green">only about the 12% of the cost of the standard convolution</Underlined>.
