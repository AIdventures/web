Left-to-right architectures may be sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks such as sentence classification,
and very harmful for token-level tasks such as question answering or named entity recognition.
There are tasks where <Underlined color="green">incorporating context from left and right</Underlined> of a token
is crucial.

BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, aims to
alleviate the problem of unidirectionality by using a <Underlined>masked language model</Underlined> (MLM) pre-training
objective, inspired by the Cloze task. In addition, authors also use a <Underlined>next sentence prediction</Underlined>
task that jointly pretrains text-pair representations.


There are two steps in BERT framework:
<Underlined color="blue">**pre-training**</Underlined> and <Underlined color="blue">**ﬁne-tuning**</Underlined>.
BERT aims to first understand the language and then use that understanding to perform
a task, instead of using the task to understand the language as previous models did.
This way, the model can be fine-tuned to perform a wide variety of tasks with minimal
additional training.

BERT paper proved that Transformer based encoder can be powerfully used
as alternative of previous language model with proper language model training method.
And more importantly, they showed that this pre-trained language model can be transferred
into any NLP task without making task specific model architecture.


## Architecture

BERT's model architecture is a multi-layer
<Underlined color="brown">**bidirectional Transformer Encoder**</Underlined>,
almost identifical to the original Transformer implementation.
If you want more details about the Transformer architecture, you can check out
my [Transformer blog post](/blog/transformer).

BERT denotes the number of the Transformer encoder blocks as $L$, the hidden size as $H$,
and the number of self-attention heads as $A$. BERT initial model designs are the following:

As we will see at the [Next Sentence Prediction](#next-sentence-prediction) section,
BERT deals with pairs of sentences. To <Underlined>differentiate between the two sentences</Underlined>,
BERT separates them with a special token called <Underlined color="purple">**`[SEP]`**</Underlined>. In addition, BERT adds
<Underlined color="green">learned embeddings</Underlined> to every token indicating whether it belongs to the first or second sentence.

Finally, for sentence-level tasks, BERT adds a special token called <Underlined color="purple">**`[CLS]`**</Underlined> at the beginning
of every sequence. The final hidden state of this token is used as the aggregate sequence
representation for sentence-level tasks such as classification.


## Pre-training

The objective of pre-training is to **learn a general-purpose language representation**
that can be used for downstream tasks. BERT focuses on two unsupervised tasks:
learning from the <Underlined>surrounding context</Underlined>, through a masked language model, and learning
from the <Underlined>relationship between two sentences</Underlined>, through a next sentence prediction task 
(helpful for some downstream tasks such as question answering).

<Underlined color="green">Both tasks are trained at the same time, summing their losses</Underlined>. For the pre-training
corpus, BERT uses the BooksCorpus (800M words) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).
Note that it is critical to use a document-level corpus rather than a shuffled sentence-level
corpus, so <Underlined>long contiguous sequences</Underlined> can be used.

### Masked Language Model

The bidirectional context understanding can enable to capture intricate dependencies
and relationships among words, resulting in more robust and contextually rich representations.

Previous methods suffered from the unidirectionality constraint: a word can only
attend to previous words in the self-attention layers. In order to train deep
bidirectional representations,
<Underlined color="green">BERT simply masks some percentage of the input tokens at random</Underlined>,
and then predicts those masked tokens. This is different from
traditional language modeling, where the model is trained to predict the next
word in a sequence where only the previous words are visible. BERT authors 
refer to this procedure as a <Underlined>masked language model</Underlined> (MLM).

The procedure is as follows:
1. Tokenize the input sequence.
2. Replace 15% tokens with: 
    - 80% of the time: <Underlined color="purple">**`[MASK]`**</Underlined> token.
    - 10% of the time: a random token.
    - 10% of the time: the original token.
3. Feed the sequence to the model.
4. Only for the replaced tokens, compute cross entropy loss between the output and the original sequence.

Although MLM allows BERT to obtain a bidirectional pre-trained model,
a downside is that it creates a mismatch between pre-training and
fine-tuning, since the `[MASK]` token does not appear during fine-tuning.
That's why BERT sometimes replaces the masked tokens with the original
and random tokens.

### Next Sentence Prediction

Some downstream tasks such as Question Answering (QA) and Natural Language Inference (NLI)
are based on understanding the *relationship* between sentences.

In order to train a model that understands sentence relationships, BERT authors
pre-train the model with a simple task called next sentence prediction.
For next sentence prediction two sentences are choosen at random, and the model is
trained to predict whether the second sentence is the actual next sentence in the original
document. The model is trained with 50% of the time the second sentence is the <Underlined>actual next sentence</Underlined>,
and 50% of the time it is a <Underlined>random sentence</Underlined> from the corpus.

BERT adds a special token called <Underlined color="purple">**`[SEP]`**</Underlined> between the two sentences.
Finally, the model introduces a <Underlined color="purple">**`[CLS]`**</Underlined> token at the beginning of the first sentence,
and the final hidden state of this token is used for next sentence prediction.


## Fine-tuning

Swapping out the appropiate inputs and outputs, BERT can be used for a wide variety
of downstream tasks, whether they involve single text or text pairs.
To do so, BERT fine-tunes all the parameters end-to-end. Compared to pre-training,
fine-tuning is relatively inexpensive.

At the output, the <Underlined>token representations</Underlined> are fed into an output layer for token-level
tasks such as named entity recognition, and the <Underlined>`[CLS]` representation</Underlined> is fed into
an output layer for classification tasks such as entailment or sentiment analysis.
